/*
PROMISE CHAINING
this is practice for promises and promise chaining with what I have learnt so far in Async Javascript.
Promises are a part of Asynchronous Javascript. But what exactly is Asynchronous Javascript? or synchronous Javascript?

Synchronous Javascript refers to the way in which JS runs code from the top to the bottom. The code below is synchronous, and it will log a, b, c in that order
*/

console.log('a');
console.log('b');
console.log('c');
